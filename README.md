# COVID-19 Research Project

This project attempts to answer the following questions:
1. How does a country's wealth impact its citizens’ access to more tested COVID-19 vaccines with higher effectiveness?
2. To what degree does a country’s wealth allow for vaccination priority for its citizens when compared to a country of lesser or greater wealth?
3. How has the distribution of vaccines and priority for wealthy nations affected the spread and evolution of new variants of COVID-19 globally?

To answer these questions, the COVID-19 Dataset by *Our World in Data* was cleaned and analyzed. More specifically, DDL was used to create a schema for the database and  SQL was used to query and manipulate the data. Lastly, Psycopg and Matplotlib were used to create visualizations of the data.

The final report, along with the conclusions, is located in the file `report.pdf`
